# Photon Realtime Client

The Photon Javascript library provides a simple to use framework to access the Photon Server and the Photon Cloud.
Cross platform communication is possible, so Javascript clients can interact with DotNet or native clients.
The SDK supports 2 APIs.


# Realtime (LoadBalancing) API
Allows to access Photon Cloud Realtime service: https://doc.photonengine.com/en-us/realtime/current/getting-started/realtime-intro

## Usage
Create an application in https://dashboard.photonengine.com/ and replace "app-id" with your app id.

```js
const Photon = require("photon-realtime")

const LBC = Photon.LoadBalancing.LoadBalancingClient;
const lbc = new LBC(Photon.ConnectionProtocol.Wss, "app-id", "1.0");

lbc.onStateChange = function (state) {
    console.log("State:", LBC.StateToName(state));
    switch (state) {
        case LBC.State.JoinedLobby:
            this.joinRoom("hello", {createIfNotExists: true});
            break;
        case LBC.State.Joined:
            lbc.raiseEvent(
                42, // event code
                "Hello, World!", // payload: primitive, array or object
                { receivers: Photon.LoadBalancing.Constants.ReceiverGroup.All } // send also to the sender
            );
            break;
    }
};

lbc.onEvent = function (code, data) {
    console.log("Event recieved:", code, data);
}
	
Photon.setOnLoad(() => {
    lbc.connectToRegionMaster("EU");
});
```
